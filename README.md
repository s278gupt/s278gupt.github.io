My updated personal website! Check it out at: https://s278gupt.github.io/

# What I used
I used Jekyll, an awesome Ruby Gem that eases the process of creating static pages and `Github Pages` to host this site for free!

The languages used are: Ruby (mostly setup and Liquid), HTML, CSS and Javascript.
