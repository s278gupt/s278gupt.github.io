    I’m a 2nd year co-op Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. That means that I’m looking to get hired for 4 month paid internships as a software engineer. 
    <br/><br/>
    I’m currently studying C++ and have experience in: Ruby on Rails, Python, C, Javascript and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes). 
    <br/><br/>
    I’m super interested in understanding big data analysis and blockchain technology, although I have limited experience with both. Companies that develop solutions that deal with socio-political, international development or energy issues fire me up.
